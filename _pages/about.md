I am Jinghan Jia, a scecond year Ph.D. student from [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/) at Michigan State University, supervised by Prof. [Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). My research focuses on the truthworthy and scalable ML algorithms. In general, my research spans the areas of machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL), optimization theory, computer vision, code understanding, natural language processing, and security. These research topics provide a solid background for my current and future research: Making AI system safe and scalable.
