I am Jinghan Jia, a scecond year Ph.D. student from [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/) at Michigan State University, supervised by Prof. [Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). My research focuses on the truthworthy and scalable ML algorithms. In general, my research spans the areas of machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL), optimization theory, computer vision, code understanding, natural language processing, and security. These research topics provide a solid background for my current and future research: Making AI system safe and scalable.  

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
